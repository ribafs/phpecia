Introduction #

Filter process helps to filter your data based on condition. It is like the WHERE statement in SQL Query. If your data is from database, we encourage you to use the filtering feature of database. However, if your data coming from other sources such as CSV or Microsoft Excel then you need Filter.

Sample Code #

<?php
use \koolreport\processes\Filter;
class MyReport extends \koolreport\KoolReport
{
    public function setup()
    {
        ...
        ->pipe(new Filter(array(
            array("region","=","asia"),
            array("customerAge",">",50)
        )))
        ...
    }
}
