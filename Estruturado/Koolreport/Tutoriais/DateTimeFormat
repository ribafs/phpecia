Introduction #

DateTimeFormat process will transform to datetime of a column to another format. To transform it requires the original format of datetime and the format you want to convert to.

There are two ways to format datetime. The first is short hand way, you assign the format directly like this.

"last_login_time"=>"F j, Y"

However there are some case, your datetime format is not in standard format, you need to enter both current format and the format you want to convert to:

"created_time"=>array(
    "from"=>"Y-m-d H:i:s",
    "to"=>"F j, Y"
)

Example #

<?php
use \koolreport\processes\DateTimeFormat;
class MyReport extends \koolreport\KoolReport
{
    public function setup()
    {
        ...
        ->pipe(new DateTimeFormat(array(
            "last_login_time"=>"F j, Y",
            "created_time"=>array(
                "from"=>"Y-m-d H:i:s",
                "to"=>"F j, Y"
            )
        )))
        ...
    }
}
