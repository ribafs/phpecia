 Time Series Aggregation

In many cases, we have data in time series for example sales or costs. We would like to summarize them by time series such as sale by day, week, month or year. In this tutorial, I would like to show you simple way to build a sale report by quarter.
Database table

Suppose we have the table sales below:
id	customerId	productId	amount	date
1	1	3	120	2017-01-01
2	2	1	150	2017-01-02
3	2	1	200	2017-01-02
...	...	...	...	...
1230	223	12	200	2017-12-31
Setup processing part

require_once "../koolreport/autoload.php";

use \koolreport\processes\TimeBucket;
use \koolreport\processes\Group;

class QuarterSaleReport extends \koolreport\KoolReport
{
    function settings()
    {
        return array(
            "dataSources"=>array(
                "mydata"=>array(
                    'connectionString' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydata',
                    'username' => 'root',
                    'password' => '',
                    'charset' => 'utf8',
                )
            )
        )
    }
    function setup()
    {
        $this->src("mydata")
        ->query("select date,amount from sales")
        ->pipe(new TimeBucket(array(
            "bucket"=>"quarter"
        )))
        ->pipe(new Group(array(
            "by"=>"date",
            "sum"=>"amount"
        )))
        ->pipe($this->dataStore("sale_by_quarter"));
    }
}

In above processing, we use the TimeBucket process. This special process will categorize the date into quarter in the year. In the next step, will pipe data into Group process and group by date which is now contain quarter data. The amount will be sumed by quarter is what we wanted.
Setup view part

We would like to use the Column Chart to display the sales of 4 quarter

<?php 
    use \koolreport\widgets\google\ColumnChart;
?>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Quarter Sale Report</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <?php 
        ColumnChart::create(array(
            "dataStore"=>$this->dataStore("sale_by_quarter")
        ));
        ?>
    </body>
</html>

Summary

In above tutorial, we learn how to deal with time series data, how to divide time series into chunks and group data by them.
