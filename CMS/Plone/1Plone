Requisitos

Plone requires several system libraries. These need to be installed by a user with root access. If you would like to install Plone using a consumer hosting service, you must ensure that the service includes SSH and root access.


Operating system

Plone has been successfully installed on:

    Nearly every popular Linux distribution;
    Nearly every popular BSD distribution
    OS X (using our OS X installer or XCode)
    Solaris and several other proprietery *nix systems
    Windows


Minimum requirements¶

    Minimum 256 MB RAM and 512 MB of swap space per Plone site
    Minimum 512 MB hard disk space

Recommended¶

    2 GB or more RAM per Plone site
    40 GB or more hard disk space


UNIX-based platforms

Plone requires Python and a complete GNU build kit including GCC including gcc, gmake, patch, tar, gunzip, bunzip2, wget.

Most required libraries listed below must be installed as development versions (dev).

Tools and libraries marked with “*” are either included with the Unified Installer or automatically downloaded.

If you use your system Python, you should use Python’s virtualenv to create an isolated virtual Python. System Pythons may use site libraries that will otherwise interfere with Zope/Plone.
Optional libraries

If Plone can find utilities that convert various document formats to text, it will include them in the site index. To get PDFs and common office automation formats indexed, add:

    poppler-utils (PDFs)
    wv (office docs)

These may be added after initial installation.
Plone 5
Python

Python 2.7 (dev), built with support for expat (xml.parsers.expat), zlib and ssl. With Plone 5.2 or greater, Python 2.7.14, 3.6, and 3.7 are supported. See manage/upgrading/version_specific_migration/upgrade_to_python3 for Plone 5.2 requirements. (Python XML support may be a separate package on some platforms.)*

virtualenv*
Libraries

    libz (dev)
    libjpeg (dev)*
    readline (dev)*
    libexpat (dev)
    libssl or openssl (dev)
    libxml2 >= 2.7.8 (dev)*
    libxslt >= 1.1.26 (dev)*

You may also need to install dependencies needed by Pillow a fork of the Python Image Libary. For further information please read: https://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html

Plone runs on a wide range of hardware, from RaspberryPi to Chromebooks, PCs and Macs, servers, and cloud deployments on Amazon EC2, Linode, Rackspace, and more.
Plone runs on most UNIX-based distributions (including Linux, BSD, Solaris, and other proprietary UNIX systems), on Windows and Mac OS.

Instalar

https://github.com/plone/Installers-UnifiedInstaller

cd /home/1029zmxnqpwoaçslR@

wget wget --no-check-certificate https://launchpad.net/plone/5.2/5.2.4/+download/Plone-5.2.4-UnifiedInstaller-1.0.tgz

tar -xf Plone-5.2.4-UnifiedInstaller-1.0

cd Plone-5.2.4-UnifiedInstaller-1.0

./install.sh $OPTION

If you run the installer with no option arguments, it will ask a series of questions about basic options.

The installer will search the system path for Python 2.7 and Python 3.x executables that are candidates for creating your installation. If you wish to specify a particular Python executable, use:

./install.sh --with-python=/usr/bin/python3 [other options]

Substituting the path to your Python 2.7 or 3.5+.

For a full list of options, many of which are not available via the dialog questions, use:

./install.sh --help
