This is what you should focus on:
• Use meaningful, coherent naming for variables, functions and classes
• Comment everything: everyone should understand your code just by reading the comments
• Use the most appropriate programming paradigm for each situation; if in doubt, OOP is usually
the best choice
• Avoid code duplication at all costs
• Make your code easy to debug and analyse
• Apply the Separation of Concern and Modularity principles: each element of your program
(class, function...) should address only one specific problem (and do it well)
• Keep your code readable: avoid too many nested loops, variable declarations inside
conditional statements (IF...ELSE) and other bad practices that could make your code less
understandable
